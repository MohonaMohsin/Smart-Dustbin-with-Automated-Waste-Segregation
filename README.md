# Smart Dustbin ðŸš® â€“ Waste Segregation System

An Arduino-based smart dustbin that automatically detects and classifies waste as **Wet**, **Dry**, or **Metal** using sensors. It improves hygiene, reduces manual sorting, and supports smart city infrastructure.

---

##  Objective

- Promote hygienic and eco-friendly waste disposal
- Reduce human contact with waste
- Automatically classify and sort waste using sensors and motors

---

##  How It Works

1. **IR sensor** detects the presence of waste
2. **Servo motor** opens the lid automatically
3. **Moisture sensor** and **metal detector** classify the waste:
   - Moisture detected â†’ Wet Waste
   - Metal detected â†’ Metal Waste
   - None â†’ Dry Waste
4. **Stepper motor** rotates sorting flap to appropriate bin
5. **Buzzer** beeps after sorting
6. Waits for the item to be removed before detecting the next
